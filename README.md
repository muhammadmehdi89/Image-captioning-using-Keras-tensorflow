# Image-captioning-using-Keras-tensorflow
This project implements an image captioning system, combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate descriptive captions for images. The system utilizes a deep learning architecture, specifically a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for generating captions.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow (or any deep learning framework of your choice)
Numpy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Pillow (PIL)
